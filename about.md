# Exploring the Thought of Ludwig von Mises

Ludwig von Mises' *Human Action* is a masterpiece of economic thought, but it can be challenging. This blog is here to help. We're working through each chapter, using AI to simplify Mises' ideas and make them easier to understand.  We'll cover everything from the basics of human action to complex market processes.  Our goal is to make Mises' insights relevant to current events and debates. This blog is a great way to supplement your reading of *Human Action* and deepen your understanding of Austrian economics.
